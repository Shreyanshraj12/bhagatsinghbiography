          <h2>Indian Revolutionary</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Bhagat Singh </b> (27 September 1907[a]  23 March 1931) was a
            charismatic Indian revolutionary[6] who participated in the mistaken
            murder of a junior British police officer[7] in what was to be
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[8] He later took
            part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative
            Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of
            sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
            household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age
            23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[9] Borrowing ideas
            from Bolshevism and anarchism,[10][11][12][13][14] he electrified a
            growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent
            introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but
            eventually successful campaign for India's independence.[15] In
            December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both
            members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
            Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
            British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is
            today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for
            the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
            intended to assassinate.[16] They held Scott responsible for the
            death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for
            having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and
            two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a
            police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet
            fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[17][18] As he
            lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the
            postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[19] Another associate
            of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head
            constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and
            Rajguru fled.[17][18] After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his
            associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging Lajpat
            Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to
            show John Saunders as their intended target instead of James
            Scott.[17] Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no
            convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he
            and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two low-intensity
            homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the Central
            Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the
            gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and allowed the
            authorities to arrest them.[20] The arrest, and the resulting
            publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders
            case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined
            fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better
            prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's
            death from starvation in September 1929. Bhagat Singh was convicted
            of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in
            March 1931, aged 23. He became a popular folk hero after his death.
            Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh did not become
            popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to
            vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and
            through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was
            forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town
            and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of
            northern India, resounded with his name."[21] In still later years,
            Singh, an atheist and socialist in adulthood, won admirers in India
            from among a political spectrum that included both communists and
            right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates,
            as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also
            involved in daring acts and were either executed or died violent
            deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature as did
            Singh, who is sometimes referred to as the Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great
            martyr" in Urdu and Punjabi).[22]
